    Chocochip Chipea Cookies
    </h1>

<div class="chickpea cookies">

<p>* 1/2 cup coconut oil (I use the deodorised one so it doesnâ€™t taste super cocnuty</P>
<p>* 3/4 cup of coconut sugar (add really as much as you like)</p>
<p>* Add a bit of maple syrup if you want a bit sweeter.</p>
<p>* 2 teaspoons vanilla</p>
<p>* 1/4 cup coconut milk</p>
<P>
* 1/4 cup almond milk
* 1 cup of chickpea flower
* 1 cup of brown rice flower.
* 2 level table spoons of cocoa powder
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* Super dark chocolate chips (no refined sugar)
* Flaky sea salt for the top of cookies.

Mix the coconut oil, sugar, vanilla together with a fork, make sure all combined.
Then mix in the coconut milk, almond milk. Add in shifted flours, cocoa powder, baking soda and salt.
It should have a oily texture (lots of coconut oil in there ha) once cooked they arenâ€™t too moist.
Finally mix in the choc chip and put onto a tray.

You can add in a sneaky half teaspoon of peanut butter to the tops of some. ðŸ¤­

Cook at 180 for about 8-10 mins.

Viola!
